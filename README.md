# Bear
This is the Bear late-run sockeye forecast.

The forecast is made using the following methods:

For ocean age 1, 2 and 4 fish, the expected return is the median value from the past ten years. 
For ocean age 3 fish, which make up about 40% of the run, the forecast is made using the ocean age 2 fish as a predictor.
